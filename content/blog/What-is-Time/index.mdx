The world remains fairly consistent at scales we can understand. But as we zoom in, and get to smaller and smaller particles – atoms, electrons and photons, we start observing apparent anomalies. Before we start digging into quantum mechanics (the science of very small things), let’s first explore a more interesting anomaly - TIME. Time is the indefinite progress of events that appears irreversible from past to present.

### Time is Relative
One of the most important conclusions of this is that time moves more slowly for a fast moving observer. Also, the fast moving observer suddenly appears very heavy to the slow moving observer, and will tend to disrupt gravity around itself. When I was younger, I was a fan of TV show called 'The Flash'. But my brain wouldn’t let me enjoy the show and instead had questions to ask. 'If the dude is running very fast, does he experience things around him in slow motion?'.

Technically, if you could sit inside a box that has extremely high gravity for a few days, you’d come out and see that a few years have elapsed outside the box. For all means and purposes, you would have “travelled” to the future, without the ability to travel back. If you built a small window into the box, you’d see everything outside happen in super-speed. Of course all this assumes you survived, because that kind of gravity will rip you to off.

### How the Brain Experiences Time
Ok, but what does this have to do with consciousness? Well, the fourth dimension, actually. Simply stating that spacetime can be distorted means that there’s a dimension above the current 3D space our brains can perceive. If a 3D space is a collection of many 2D spaces, then a 4D space is a collection of many 3D spaces – similar to how each frame of a movie is a separate “scene”. In the average movie, there are 29.97 frames per second. Each frame lasts for basically 1/29.97 seconds.

Take the example of a bus in the real world. A bus can take you from Place A to Place B. But Place A and Place B already exist – the bus is simply a vehicle taking you there in 3D space. Similarly, your brain is a vehicle that takes you from TimePoint A to TimePoint B in 4D space – you own a something like a bus that’s simply traversing between two “times” in a predefined 4D space. Just like how the two places the bus is ferrying you between already exist, the two “time points” your brain is taking you between already exist. We don’t perceive this because our brains aren’t built to – which is why we only found out using a variety of measuring devices. 

### 4th Dimension Exists?

Until now, humans have pretty much been doing the same thing. We can’t explain how a 4th dimension works, because we can’t comprehend it. The character’s brain wouldn’t have found the need to process the 3rd dimension, because there’s no way he can even interact with or influence the 3rd dimension.

  📍 Conclusion: There definitely exists a 4th dimension, but we can’t comprehend it because our brains haven’t evolved the need to.
