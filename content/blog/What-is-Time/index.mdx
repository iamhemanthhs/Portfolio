The world remains fairly consistent at scales we can understand. But as we zoom in, and get to smaller and smaller particles – atoms, electrons and photons, we start observing apparent anomalies. Before we start digging into quantum mechanics (the science of very small things), let’s first explore a more interesting anomaly - TIME. Time is the indefinite progress of events that appears irreversible from past to present.

One of the most important conclusions of this is that time moves more slowly for a fast moving observer. Also, the fast moving observer suddenly appears very heavy to the slow moving observer, and will tend to disrupt gravity around itself. When I was younger, I was a fan of TV show called 'The Flash'. But my brain wouldn’t let me enjoy the show and instead had questions to ask. 'If the dude is running very fast, does he experience things around him in slow motion?'.
